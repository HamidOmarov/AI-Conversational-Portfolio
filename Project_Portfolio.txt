Section 1: AI & Program Management Projects
Project: AI Content Factory - Operations Dashboard & Public Portfolio

My Role: Founder, Systems Architect

Description: To address the challenge of creating high-quality English content with developing spoken fluency, I architected a comprehensive, automated content creation system. This wasn't just about using AI tools; it was about designing a robust operational workflow.

Key Contributions:

I built a centralized "AI Operations Dashboard" in Notion to manage the entire content lifecycle, from ideation and scripting to final production and publishing.

I designed a repeatable 6-step content workflow, integrating tools like ChatGPT, ElevenLabs, and Midjourney into a seamless pipeline.

I documented this entire system in a public GitHub repository, creating a "live portfolio" that transparently showcases my methodology.

Outcome: This project demonstrates my core ability to transform a complex challenge into a structured, scalable system. It is a direct showcase of my skills in Program Management, Systems Thinking, Process Automation, and applied Generative AI.
