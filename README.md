# **Hamid Omarov's Interactive AI Assistant**

Welcome to my interactive portfolio project.

## **Overview**

This AI assistant has been trained on my personal story, detailed work experience, and project portfolio. You can ask it questions in plain English to learn about my skills, challenges, and journey from a "Chaos Operator" to an "AI Architect."

This project demonstrates my practical skills in:
- **Python & Gradio** for rapid web app development.
- **AI Systems Thinking** for creating a functional knowledge retrieval system.
- **Rapid Prototyping & Deployment** on the Hugging Face platform.

## **How to Use**

Simply type your question into the textbox and press enter. Here are some examples:

- *"Tell me about your most challenging project."*
- *"Why did you switch from Civil Engineering to AI?"*
- *"What are your skills in program management?"*
